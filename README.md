# osbuild-ks

Transform kickstart files into osbuild manifest files. Just another rainy
sunday project.

## Usage
You can run `osbuild-ks` with `osbuild-ks <src> <dst>`. The `<src>` has to be a
file in the Kickstart format, the resulting osbuild manifest will be written to
`<dst>`. If your Kickstart file includes other files then you will want to pass
`-I <include>` for the path to use for the other files if they aren't in `.`.
